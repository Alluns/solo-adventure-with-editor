## Solo Adventure With Editor

The Solo Adventure With Editor is a way to play, edit and create your very own choose your own adventure games.

### Goals for the project

   A minimalistic text-based interface för playing the adventure.
   Item's that unlock choises in certain situations. Example: Being unable to open a crate unless you have previously found a crowbar.
   Usage of color to add flavor to the text and to what the players feels while playing. For example if the scene was cold then the background could gain a blue tint.
   An editor/creator for changing and creating adventures with relative ease.
